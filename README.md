This project is called Job Hunter and is a collection of web scrapers that search various job websites and return a compiled list of internships for the user to sift through and find internships they want to apply to. The websites being scraped are Glassdoor, Indeed, and Simply Hire and a dictionary of all of the relevant job information for a position that the user types into the search prompt is returned. The future goal is to develop this into a larger app with a UI that can display these results in an easier to use manner.
